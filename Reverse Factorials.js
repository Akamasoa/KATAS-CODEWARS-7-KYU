/*
DESCRIPTION:
I'm sure you're familiar with factorials â€“ that is, the product of an integer and all the integers below it.

For example, 5! = 120, as 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120

Your challenge is to create a function that takes any number and returns the number that it is a factorial of. So, if your function receives 120, it should return "5!" (as a string).

Of course, not every number is a factorial of another. In this case, your function would return "None" (as a string).

Examples
120 will return "5!"
24 will return "4!"
150 will return "None"

function reverseFactorial(num) {
  let f = 1, x = 1;
  while( f < num ) f = ++x*f;
  return f == num ? x + "!" : "None"
}

/*
function reverseFactorial(num) {
  var product = 1,
      count = 1;
  while(product!=num){
    count++;
    product = product*count;
    if(product>num)
      return "None";
  }
  return ""+count+"!";
}
